        <p class="about-ramayan">
            The Ramayana written by Tulsidas known as <span>Ramcharitmanas</span>, is a sixteenth century epic. The
            story
            revolves around <span>Rama</span>,
            who was the seventh avatar of the Hindu God <span>Vishnu</span>. He is the central figure of the Hindu epic
            <span>Ramayana</span>, which is the
            principal narration of the events connected to His incarnation on earth, His ideals and His greatness. He
            was
            the eldest son of
            King Dashratha- the ruler of Kosala Kingdom. Rama's life and journey is one of adherence to dharma despite
            harsh
            tests and
            obstacles and many pains of life and time. This adherence made him earn the name of <span>Maryada
                Purushottam</span> which
            literally
            means <span>The Perfect Man</span> or <span>Lord of Self-Control</span> or <span>Lord of Virtue</span>. For
            the sake of his father's honour, Rama
            abandons his
            claim to Ayodhya's throne to serve an exile of fourteen years in the forest. His wife Sita and brother
            Lakshmana
            decide to join
            him, and all three spend the fourteen years in exile together. While in exile, Sita is kidnapped by Ravana,
            the
            king of Lanka.
            After a long and arduous search, Rama fights a colossal war against Ravana's armies. In a war of powerful
            and
            magical
            beings, greatly destructive weaponry and battles, Rama slays Ravana in battle and liberates his wife. Having
            completed his
            exile, Rama returns to be crowned king in Ayodhya and eventually becomes the emperor. The whole story is
            divided
            into
            seven parts known as 'Kands'
